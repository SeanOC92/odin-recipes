This project is about creating a multiple page recipe website using the Command line, Github, and HTML skills I have learned so far.
I will have to create the Github repository and clone it to my local machine and then use Gits saving process of add, commit and push to save a history of my work.
I will have to use the proper command line commands to create the appropriate files and directories required and navigate to them appropriately.
I will have to use my html skills to create a viewable, formatted, and properly coded website containing text, images, and links.
